# Welcome to Type Off!

# Type off is the multiplayer typing to game to help you learn the keyboard with a friend.
# First you'll pick a level of difficulty based on how well you and a friend know the board.
# You and your friend will take turns playing, 
# and you'll click keys corresponding to the letters on the screen.
# If you make a word out of those letters, you'll get bonus points!
# The player with the most points from that round wins!

# Have fun and happy typing!
